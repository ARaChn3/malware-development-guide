# ðŸš€ Introduction

Before I begin, _**I'd like to state that I'm in no way responsible for how you use this information;**_ _**type responsibly!**_



I'm writing this "book" because I noticed a stark lack of proper materials/guides that extensively teach _how_ to develop malware. Sure, there's content on how to _analyze_ malware, how to _prevent malware,_ and all sorts of stuff, but no "this is how you develop a worm, have fun!". _Why?_ I hear you ask; well, I think that lately, cybersecurity, both in the black hat and white hat (and whatever other hats are out there) has increasingly been all about _profit and money_. It's quite scarce to see some proper _Hacktivism_ in action in public (I'll probably make a rant post on my blog, so check that if you're confused about what I mean). Imagine if people who wanted to make a change were able to design some malware to achieve their purposes.&#x20;

This may as well be the stupidest set of things I've ever typed out and in all likelihood, this will be taken down or be ignored/go stale (although I plan to avoid that with all my might). So before all the _morally_ _good_ folk of the inter-web come to hunt me down with pitchforks and torches, I'd like to make a few points clear before you, the reader, proceed:

* I'm not writing this so that people use this information to get themselves arrested because they committed cybercrimes. If you wanna learn malware development, fine, but whatever you do with this information isn't my responsibility. It's all fun in games and pranks, but don't use this to do something illegal.
* I'm putting this information out here because, like me, some truly curious folks want nothing more than to learn _how the f\*\*\*_ this "malware" stuff works, but can't find a definitive guide that _just tells_ them how to do it all in a no-bullshit, no-fluffy-language manner.&#x20;
* Just because there's a _chance_ that this may be used with ill intent does not make it a bad thing. **Intent** is what matters.&#x20;
* And lastly, if you wanna use this for malicious purposes, like DDoS-ing some organization's servers, go ahead, but don't hold me responsible for whatever the consequences; But remember: "_It's only a crime if you get caught"._&#x20;



The points may be poorly phrased, but it hopefully gets the point across. Before you begin, I'd like to mention that this is something I'm writing _on the go_ (i.e. I'm writing this stuff as I learn), so it may not be perfect and complete, however, I'll try my best to make it as good as possible. Anyways, **have fun y'all.**
