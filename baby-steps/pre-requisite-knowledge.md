# ðŸ“” Pre-requisite Knowledge

Ok, so you wanna get into some good ol' malware development and are unsure where to begin. Well, you've come to the right place! This is the no-bullshit, no strings attached starting point. That being said, you should remember that malware development isn't a _beginner's_ field of play. If you wanna exploit a system, you gotta at least have some knowledge about _how the system works_ at the very least.â€‹To begin your journey, you'll need to get some stuff down before you proceed:

* Basic scripting skills (stuff like `bash`, `perl`, `python`, `powershell`)
* Programming  (see [programming-guide.md](programming-guide.md "mention"))
* Memory representation and how it works (see [memory-representation.md](../appendix/memory-representation.md "mention")â€‹)
* An understanding of whatever you're trying to exploit. (see [vulnerability-analysis.md](vulnerability-analysis.md "mention"))

And that's pretty much it! The more knowledge you have, the better. Remember, don't rush it, this stuff takes time to learn, you won't go through this _today_ and wake up a master hacker-malware-dev-man _tomorrow_. Take your time and be sure to grow your knowledge base over time. If you're consistent, you'll grow at a stable rate, don't jump from topic to topic, give each an appropriate amount of time and thought. Be thorough and focused.



I would also highly recommend that you maintain some _notes_ (use whatever you want, it doesn't matter).
