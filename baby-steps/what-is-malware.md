# What is Malware?

According to Wikipedia:&#x20;

> Malware (a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) for _malicious software_)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#cite\_note-:4-1) is any [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) intentionally designed to cause disruption to a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer), [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server\_\(computing\)), [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client\_\(computing\)), or [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_network), leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

In simple words: _software that does bad stuff is malware._

_However_, I personally believe that this "definition" is a bit lacking. Yeah sure, the word literally means "_bad software",_ but that doesn't summarize what _malware_ truly is about. **Merriam-Webster** defines malware as:

> software designed to interfere with a computer's normal functioning

Which is a _much_ better way to define it, since it doesn't paint it as something that's _just evil/bad_. If you haven't yet caught on, **jokes** are not bad, and malware certainly can be designed for joking with people and/or trolling or messing with them. Sure there are people who'll take it a tad bit too far, but in the end, if a thing is used for something evil doesn't make it inherently evil (Same as the case with the knowledge used for developing nuclear bombs).
