# Worms

Worms are quite simple on surface level. They're just _self-propagating_ programs that usually just target a particular network by exploiting some kind of vulnerability and infect each device on the nework progressively.&#x20;

A worm can be used to do all sorts of stuff, including but not limited to: spying, destruction, trolling, DoS/DDoS, etc.&#x20;
