Heyyy\~

I hope you're finding this very-easy-to-find-and-totally-not-useless content _very very_ helpful. I do kinda realize that this is turning into a kinda red-team manual clone, but y'all better bet your arses that I'm determined to keep the malware dev theme running.&#x20;



Also, if you _do_ read this, please comment anything, I'd rather y'all talk shit in the comments ngl.

Imma add some more entries in the future if i feel like it. :man\_shrugging:
